# Deployment and CI/CD

Used digital ocean as the hosing service, in particular the app platform. 

One of the benefits of using Digital Ocean as the hosting provider means that any changes made to the master/main branch are automatially refelcted on the live app. 


# Tech Stack 

- React for componenets 
- Tailwind for the styling
- Context API for sate mamangement
